      <body><p style="font-style: italic; color:white; float:right">Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the mascot of <br>The Walt Disney Company.
        He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks<br> at the Walt Disney Studios  in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who <br> typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, 
        and white gloves,<br> Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable characters. Created <br>as a replacement for a prior Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,<br> 
        Mickey first appeared in the short Plane Crazy, debuting publicly in the <br>short film Steamboat  Willie (1928), one of the first sound cartoons.<br>  He went on to 
        appear in over 130 films, including The Band Concert (1935), <br>Brave Little Tailor (1938), and Fantasia (1940). Mickey appeared <br>primarily in short films, but also 
        occasionally in feature-length films.<br> Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for <br>Best Animated Short Film, one of which, Lend a Paw, won 
        the award in 1942. <br>In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the <br>Hollywood Walk of Fame.
            Beginning in 1930, Mickey has also been featured <br>extensively as a comic strip character. The Mickey Mouse comic strip, drawn <br>primarilyby Floyd Gottfredson, 
            ran for 45 years.Mickey has also appeared in <br> comic books such as Disney Italy's Topolino, MM - Mickey Mouse Mystery<br> Magazine, and Wizards of Mickey, and in 
            television series such as The Mickey <br>Mouse Club (1955â€“1996) and others. He also appears in other media such as <br>video games as well as merchandising and is a
            meetable character at the Disney <br>parks.Mickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet <br>dog Pluto, his friends Donald Duck and Goofy,
            and his nemesis Pete,<br>among others (see Mickey Mouse universe). Though originally characterized <br>as a cheeky lovable rogue, Mickey was rebranded over time as a 
            nice guy,<br> usually seen as an honest and bodacious hero. In 2009, Disney began to <br>rebrand the character again by putting less emphasis on his friendly,<br> 
            well-meaning persona and reintroducing the more menacing and stubborn <br>sides of his personality, beginning with the video game Epic Mickey.[3]<br>

            <h4 style="font-style: italic; color:white; float:right">Mickey Mouse was created as a replacement for swald the Lucky Rabbit,an earlier cartoon character created 
                by the Disney studio for Charles Mintz, a film producer who distributed product through Universal Studios.[4] In the spring of 1928, with the series going strong, 
                Disney asked Mintz for an increase in the budget. But Mintz instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent budget cut, and as leverage, he reminded Disney that 
                Universal owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed most of Disney's current employees to his new contract. Angrily, Disney refused the deal 
                and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed Mintz. Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from 
                scratch. The new Disney Studio initially consisted of animator Ub Iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist, Les Clark, who together with Wilfred Jackson were among 
                the few who remained loyal to Walt. One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters 
                produced by his company.In the spring of 1928, Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of various animals, such as 
                dogs and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were also rejected. They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. 
                A male frog was also rejected. It would later show up in Iwerks' own Flip the Frog series.[5] Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse from a tame mouse 
                at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.[6] In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney. These inspired 
                Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney.[5] "Mortimer Mouse" had been Disney's original name for the character before his wife, Lillian, convinced him 
                to change it, and ultimately Mickey Mouse came to be.[7][8] The actor Mickey Rooney claimed that, during his Mickey McGuire days, he met cartoonist Walt Disney at 
                the Warner Brothers studio, and that Disney was inspired to name Mickey Mouse after him.[9] This claim, however, has been debunked by Disney historian Jim Korkis, 
                since at the time of Mickey Mouse's development, Disney Studios had been located on Hyperion Avenue for several years, and Walt Disney never kept an office or other 
                working space at Warner Brothers, having no professional relationship with Warner Brothers, as the Alice Comedies and Oswald cartoons were distributed by Universal.</h4>
